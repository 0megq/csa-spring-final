Idea: 2d golfing game
- Player aims an arrow indicating direction and power of golf swing
- Extra: Show player and swinging golf stick
- Simulate projectile motion of ball in air
- Ball must be in front of the flag for certain time before it is counted as falling in the hole
- Ball has a velocity
- Gravity (acceleration) is constantly applied
- When touching ground normal force (acceleration) is applied up
- Impulse (velocity) of hit is applied to ball
- Ball will bounce on ground (inelastic collision)
    - bounce factor
PlayerInput class
    variables
        - ballPosition
        - maxLength
    functions
        - 
Ball class
    variables
        - velocity (Vector2)
        - boundingBox (AABB)
        - restitution/bounce (double)
        - gravity (double)
        
    functions
        - hit (sets velocity and starts simulation)
        - simulate (simulate )
        - get velocity (when velocity is near zero the ball will stop being simulated and the player can hit the ball again)

AABB class (Axis aligned bounding box)
    variables
        - position (Vector2) - top left
        - size (Vector2)
    functions
        - isColliding(checks if colliding with other AABB)

AABBDrawSettings
    variables
        - sidesToDraw (boolean[4] left,top,right,bot)
        - fill color
        - drawType (fill, hollow, fill and outline)
        - outline color
        - outline width

AABBDrawer
    variables
        - AABB
        - AABBDrawSettings
    functions
        - Draw(Graphics g)

Vector2 class
    variables
        - x (double)
        - y (double)

    functions
        - get as point (converts vector2 to point)
        - scaling and adding/substracting
        - rotating
        - get angle
        - equals
        - static get up, down, left, right

World class (deals with physics simulation)
    variables
        - static finals for constants like (input max distance)
        - ball
        - ground AABB[]
        - hole (AABB)
    functions
        - update (called when simulating the ball)
        - isBallInHole (returns whether or not ball is in the hole)
        - loadLevel (takes a level class and deep copies the variables)
        - onPlayerMouseRelease (gets mouse direction to ball and distance)
        
Level class (information for how a level is setup)
    variables
        - Vector2 ballStart
        - AABB[] ground
        - AABB hole
        - int 

Graphics class
    functions
        - draw AABB

Classes:
- Graphics/UI
